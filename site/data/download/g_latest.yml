# The ZAP version is automatically updated by zaproxy/zap-admin repo.

title: Latest Versions
info:
- We maintain a set of pages containing XML with links to the latest ZAP release files
- You can use them to automatically pull down the latest ZAP release for the platform you need.
- ZAP uses similar URLs when checking for updates.
- The file [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions.xml) is version independent and always points to the latest release.
- There are also version specific files that define the add-ons on the ZAP Marketplace for that release stream.
- The 2.15 release stream uses [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions-2.15.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions-2.15.xml)
- The development code uses [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions-dev.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions-dev.xml)
- These files are usually the same, but it does allow us to release add-ons which depend on core features which have been added since the current stable release.
- See [3rd Party Package Maintenance](/3rd-party-package-maintenance) for details of how 3rd party packages which wrap ZAP are maintained.
