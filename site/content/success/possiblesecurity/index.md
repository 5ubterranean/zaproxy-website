At Possible Security, we deliver specialized, expert-driven cybersecurity services to high-profile clients across industries. Our focus areas include penetration testing, red teaming, premium audits, and consulting. Based in Riga – the capital of Latvia and the jewel of Northern Europe – we are one of the few market leaders in the field – serving government institutions, critical infrastructure providers, and private sector clients with complex security needs.

ZAP is used in almost all of our web application penetration tests. Its versatility, frequent updates, and strong community support make it one of the most valuable tools. We love features like the request editor, breakpoints, and session saving/exporting, which enhance the depth and efficiency of our testing. ZAP also proves useful in mobile application assessments, where its flexibility allows us to adapt to a wide range of testing scenarios.

Our technical work combines hands-on security testing and expert consulting in information security, computer systems security, physical security, and network security. Tools like ZAP add real depth to our process – and clarity to the results.

We are grateful to the ZAP community for maintaining such a powerful and versatile tool – one that continues to evolve within the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape. You can bet ZAP is staying as a core component of our workflow here at Possible Security.
