[![ZAPBot and Jit](images/zapbot-jit.png)](https://jit.io/zap)

I am delighted to announce that I have joined [Jit](https://jit.io) as a Distinguished Engineer, 
with a joint vision on continuing to support and sponsor my work on ZAP. 
With this, Jit will now be considered a ZAP [Platinum Supporter](/supporters/).

Jit as a platform combines and orchestrates best-in-breed open source security tools, 
and that of course includes ZAP as the key [DAST solution](https://www.jit.io/zap).

With Jitâ€™s support I will be able to focus nearly all of my time working on ZAP and making it better for everyone.

As always, you can be sure that ZAP will stay open source and completely free, and will remain the best OSS DAST option for third party integrators.
