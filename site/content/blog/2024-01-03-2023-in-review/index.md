Happy New Year, and welcome to the ZAP review for 2023!

### ZAP Chat Video

This year we decided review the year as a [ZAP Chat](/zap-chat/) episode: 

{{<youtube uuid="VPVuxftv99A">}}

### Headline Changes
In 2023 we:
* Published 2 major releases: [2.13.0](/blog/2023-07-12-zap-2.13.0/) and [2.14.0](/blog/2023-10-12-zap-2-14-0/)
* Joined the [Software Security Project](/blog/2023-08-01-zap-is-joining-the-software-security-project/)
* Mentored 2 successful GSoC projects: [Browser Recorder](/blog/2023-09-11-browser-recorder/) and [Postman Import](/blog/2023-09-25-postman-add-on/)
* Started a new Video series - [ZAP Chat](/zap-chat/) and released 12 videos.
* Published more than 300 [add-on releases](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/releases)

According to [Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/zaproxy/) 
we had a total of __2070 commits__ across the 4 main repos thanks to __57 contributors__.

And based on our [Telemetry](/faq/what-calls-home-does-zap-make/#telemetry) the 
[Headline Statistics](/docs/statistics/) for 2023 were:
* Number of Times ZAP was Started: __30 Million__ (up from 14 Million last year)
* Number of Active Scans: __260 Million__ (significantly up from 5 Million)
* Number of Alerts Raised: __12 Billion__ (up from 5.6 Billion)
* Number of Active Scan Messages Sent: __30 Billion__ (up from 15 Billion)

### Significant Enhancements

The [Automation Framework](/docs/automate/automation-framework/) was a big focus last year and now supports 15 jobs which cover a wide range of functionality.

[Authentication](/docs/authentication/) was another focus and [Autodetection](/docs/authentication/auto-detection/) is a major step forwards in making it easier to authenticate to web apps, especially modern ones.

And last but not least the new [ZAPit](/docs/authentication/auto-detection/) scan allows you to perform a very quick ‘reconnaissance’ scan of a URL from the command line.

### Looking forward to 2024

As mentioned in the video, please fill in the [ZAP User Personas Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOW2Evb7Sj9dbj6Gw19TG3k49BJU5amgBDcRkeyL9qg13m-w/viewform) if you have not done so already.
This will help shape the future direction of ZAP.

And if you have ideas for raising money for ZAP then please [get in touch](mailto:zaproxy-admin@googlegroups.com).

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to ZAP in any way, and wishing you all a successful and secure 2024!
