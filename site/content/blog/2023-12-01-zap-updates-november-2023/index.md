## Highlights

### Modern Web App Handling

We published the blog post [Handling Modern Web Apps Better - Part 1](/blog/2023-11-03-handling-modern-web-apps-better-part1/)
and released a video [ZAP Chat 05 Modern Apps Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq_d7OLmMfw) 
which show how we are starting to improve how ZAP can handle modern web apps more effectively.

We also enhanced to Client add-on to support [passive scanning](/docs/desktop/addons/client-side-integration/pscan/) which adds 3 more alerts which ZAP can report:

* [Information Disclosure - Information in Browser Storage](/docs/alerts/120000/)
* [Information Disclosure - Sensitive Information in Browser Storage](/docs/alerts/120001/)
* [Information Disclosure - JWT in Browser Storage](/docs/alerts/120002/)

### ZAP Chat Video Series

We released 5 (!) new [ZAP Chat](/zap-chat/) videos last month:

* [ZAP Chat 05 Modern Apps Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq_d7OLmMfw)
* [ZAP Chat 06 Automation Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnCbIAnauD8)

## Ongoing Work

### Modern Web App Handling
See the highlights above!

### Improved Automation Capabilities
This month we started the [Getting Further with ZAP Automation](/docs/getting-further/automation/) guide.

We also made good progress on a new GitHub Action which will support the [Automation Framework](/docs/automate/automation-framework/) - an early version of that will hopefully be released soon!

### Usability Enhancements
We have started discussions around improving the usability of the ZAP GUI and minor enhancements are already on their way.
