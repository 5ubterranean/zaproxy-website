## Highlights

### The Open Source Fellowship

In the [ZAP Funding and the Open Source Fellowship](/blog/2024-03-13-zap-funding-and-the-open-source-fellowship/)
blog post we announced that ZAP is now supported by the [Crash Override](https://crashoverride.com/?zap=web) 
Open Source Fellowship.

This is a huge win for the ZAP project and saved it from potential closure.

The blog also explains why we still need to focus on raising money for ZAP in order to secure its future.

### ZAProxy Ltd

In related news, we have started a new company dedicated to raise money for ZAP development - [ZAProxy Ltd](https://www.zaproxy.com).
This is a non profit company based in the UK.

For details of the commercial support options available see the [Support](/support) page.
All of the money raised for any of these services will help fund ZAP development.

### Full Support for Script Scan Rules

Some significant changes have been made which will allow script scan rules to be treated as "first class citizens".
This means that they can be treated in the same way as Java based scan rules and can be individually referenced in
active scan policies and the passive scan rule configuration.

Expect a blog post soon which will explain everything!

### Authentication Decision tree

A new authentication guide, in the form of a decision tree, was made available via https://github.com/psiinon/zap-auth-dt/wiki

The guide is now being migrated to this website.

## Ongoing Work

### Improved Automation Capabilities

The new GitHub Action which will support the [Automation Framework](/docs/automate/automation-framework/)
is progressing well and will hopefully be released in April.

## Website Updates

The following new pages were added to the website in January.
