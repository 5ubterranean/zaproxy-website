You want to find out as much info about a URL as possible *really quickly*.

Why? Well, you could be:

* A pentester just starting your week looking at a new set of apps
* A security professional who has just found out about a new public web app from your company you were not previously aware of
* A developer who has just been given an existing web app to maintain

So ... ZAPit!

### ZAP Chat Video

{{<youtube uuid="9RbmkT9rG5w">}}

ZAPit is a new feature in [2.14.0](/blog/2023-10-12-zap-2-14-0/) which 
performs a quick ‘reconnaissance’ scan of the URL specified. It currently only runs from the command line.

For more details see the [ZAPit](/docs/desktop/addons/quick-start/zapit/) help page.

### ZAP Chat Video Commands

The commands I used in the above video were:

Download and run bash in the ZAP stable docker image (not required if you have ZAP installed locally):
```bash
docker pull softwaresecurityproject/zap-stable
docker run -it softwaresecurityproject/zap-stable bash
```

Update ZAP and install [Wappalyzer](/docs/desktop/addons/technology-detection/) and the [Beta Passive Scan Rules](/docs/desktop/addons/passive-scan-rules-beta/):
```bash
./zap.sh -cmd -addonupdate -addoninstall wappalyzer -addoninstall pscanrulesBeta
```

Run ZAP against example.com (or any other URL you specify):
```bash
./zap.sh -cmd -zapit https://www.example.com
```

### Feedback
