## HeadLine News!
I am delighted to announce that ZAP has joined forces with [Checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/) to secure the project’s future success.
Checkmarx will employ all three of the ZAP project leaders (myself, [Ricardo](/docs/team/thc202/), and [Rick](/docs/team/kingthorin/)),
to work on both ZAP and Checkmarx' DAST solution (built on top of ZAP). 

This is by far the biggest investment any one company has made in ZAP and ensures that ZAP will continue to thrive.

## What Does This Mean In Practice?
As you may have noticed on the website, ZAP will now be known as “ZAP by Checkmarx”.

ZAP will stay under the control of the ZAP Core Team, remain open source, and stay licensed under Apache v2.
We are still community focused, but Checkmarx’ support will enable us to support this community even better than before.

While Checkmarx will have a direct influence on our roadmap, we're confident that their priorities align closely with our existing roadmap - one that is based on the features that many of you have been asking for.

The most important change is that ZAP will have proper backing - for the first time in its history.
With more people exclusively focused on ZAP as part of their daily work, we will be able to improve ZAP at a faster rate than ever before.

Another big change for us is that we will also get direct access to Checkmarx’ customer base. 
As an open source project, we often struggle to get the detailed information we need to resolve user problems.
Many companies simply cannot share the level of detail we need from them unless there is a contract in place.
This change will not only allow us to support those customers more effectively, but also support overarching improvements for everyone who uses ZAP.

For Checkmarx’ take on our new partnership, check out their announcement:

## Thank You to CrashOverride
Last but definitely not least, a huge thank you to [CrashOverride](https://crashoverride.com/?zap=web), who stepped up and 
[supported us](/blog/2024-03-13-zap-funding-and-the-open-source-fellowship/) when we needed it most. 
Without their help and support the ZAP project may not have survived.
