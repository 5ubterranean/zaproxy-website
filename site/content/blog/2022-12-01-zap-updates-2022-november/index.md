There were no updates for October, but that does not mean that nothing happened!

### ZAP 2.12.0!

At the end of October we released ZAP [2.12.0](/blog/2022-10-27-zap-2-12-0-the-ten-thousand-star-release/).
Full releases are obviously a major event for us (as we only usually do a couple a year) and this was
the reason for no October updates blog post :grin:

Uptake has been very good, but we are aware of some problems when updating add-ons - [see below](#zap-2120-updating-issues).

### SARIF Reports

The [Report Generation](/docs/desktop/addons/report-generation/) add-on now supports
[SARIF JSON](/docs/desktop/addons/report-generation/report-sarif-json/) reports, thanks to 
[Albert Tregnaghi](https://twitter.com/dejcup).

### Monthly Active Scan Statistics

At the start of November we published statistics on the first set of 
[Monthly Active Scan Rule Statistics](/blog/2022-11-03-monthly-active-scan-rule-statistics/).
We aim to update these every month, and are still not aware of any other web scanners (commercial or open source) who are publishing equivalent data.

### OWASP AppSec USA

The OWASP Global AppSec USA Conference was held in San Francisco.

This was going to be the first conference I had ever attended without speaking at .. 
but then one of the keynote speakers had to drop out and I was asked to take their place ðŸ˜²

I decided I needed to have a bigger scope than 'just' ZAP so ended up giving a talk titled
[OWASP - What's the Point?](https://owasp2022globalappsecsf.sched.com/event/1EHTz).

It seemed to go down well and I'll share the recording once it has been published.

I talked to a lot of people and heard some great feedback about ZAP!
I also made some very good contacts, including people and companies who we now plan to collaborate with - 
more details when we have something to show :wink:.

### DevOpsDays Tel Aviv

I will be giving a Spotlight Talk at [DevOpsDays Tel Aviv](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-tel-aviv/welcome/) on 
"Evolution of OSS: Perspective from a Decade of Maintaining A (Wildly) Popular Open Source Project " - no prizes for guessing which project that is :wink:.

If you attend then please come over and say "Hi"! :grin:

### Stats

Statistics from the 2 main ZAP repos.

#### [zaproxy](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/pulse/monthly)

### Ongoing Work

#### HTTP/2 Support

This is going very well and is nearing completion!

Stay tuned for an announcement, hopefully very soon...

#### ZAP 2.12.0 Updating Issues

We are aware of problems updating add-ons in ZAP 2.12.0 

The symptoms include a message saying that the mandatory "network" add-on is missing and various errors
relating the the installing and uninstalling of add-ons.

This problem can occur with ZAP installed locally and when using the Docker images.

The workaround is to update ZAP on the command line and then to start it again as before.

To update ZAP on the command line run:

`zap.sh -cmd -addonupdate`

We have a solution to this problem but it requires a core change.

This will be available in the Live and Weekly releases very soon, and as long as we do not receive any more
reports of problems with those then we will look at releasing a new bug fix version - 2.12.1.
