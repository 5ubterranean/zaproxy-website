I'm delighted to be able to announce that last week ZAP won an award for being one of the Best Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools in the inaugural 
[DefectDojo Awards](
https://defectdojo.com/blog/announcing-the-defectdojo-open-source-security-awards). 

This award recognizes ZAP’s contributions to the open-source cybersecurity ecosystem.

About ZAP, DefectDojo CEO Greg Anderson said: 

> "Who is surprised?! There aren’t words to properly articulate the high praise ZAP deserves. In addition to being a cornerstone of dynamic scanning, ZAP has every option you could hope for to make automation easy including an API, GitHub Actions, Wrappers, etc."

The DefectDojo Awards celebrate open-source tools and solutions that provide the most utility to
cybersecurity professionals across five categories: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Static
Application Security Testing (SAST), Infrastructure, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and Secrets
Scanning. As a leading open-source cybersecurity provider in its own right, DefectDojo evaluated tools
based on their noisiness, accuracy and robustness of results. Winners were selected by CEO Greg
Anderson and CTO Matt Tesauro in consultation with a number of other leading voices in open-source
cybersecurity.
