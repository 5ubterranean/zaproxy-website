## Highlights

### ZAP Desktop Context Menus

All of the ZAP desktop context menus have been restructured to make them easier to use.

As this has required core changes the new menus cannot be updated in 2.14.0.
However they are available in the latest [weekly release](/download/#weekly) and will of course be in the next full ZAP release.

The new Sites context menu:

And the new Request context menu:

### OWASP Docker Org Depreciation

From today we will no longer be updating the ZAP releases in the OWASP Docker Hub organisation.

Please change to use `ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy` or `softwaresecurityproject` as per the [Downloads page](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/#docker).

### ZAP Funding

A lot of time and effort has once again been spent on securing ZAP's future - expect a major announcement fairly soon!

### Google Summer of Code

Unfortunately we were not chosen to be a Google Summer of Code mentoring organisation ðŸ˜ž.

However the good news it that a student still wants to work on one of the proposed GSoC projects, 
[gRPC support](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7695), so we will be mentoring them outside of GSoC :grin:.

If you would like to be mentored to work on ZAP then just get in touch via the [Developer Group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop).

## Ongoing Work

### Improved Automation Capabilities

More progress has been made on a new GitHub Action which will support the [Automation Framework](/docs/automate/automation-framework/).

### Alert Details and Examples

All of the [alerts](/docs/alerts/) are being reviewed and where necessary updated to ensure they have 
up to date details and examples.
