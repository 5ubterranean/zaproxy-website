## Highlights

Once again it's been a very busy couple of months for the ZAP team. So busy that we didn't have time to post an update last month!

### New Introduction Video

We have a brand new "Intro to ZAP by Checkmarx" video:

{{< youtube uuid="yywD8ebNn6o" >}}

Feedback appreciated ðŸ˜€

### Authentication Changes

Authentication has continued to be a big focus for us. The documentation is definitely lagging behind, but the plan is to 
publish new articles / blog posts ASAP.

### Browser Extensions

As you may already know, ZAP now has 2 browser extensions. These were originally introduced to stream data from
the browser back to ZAP, but they have been extended to support recording the actions you take in the browser.

ZAP now supports these [Client Side Scripts](/docs/desktop/addons/client-side-integration/record/) as authentication scripts,
so you can use them to record complex authentication flows.

#### ZAP Full Extension

The "Full" extension is supported on Firefox and Chrome:
* [Firefox - ZAP by Checkmarx Browser Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/zap-browser-extension)
* [Chrome - ZAP by Checkmarx Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zap-by-checkmarx-browser/cgkggmillbmmpokepnicllalaohphffo)

While these are available on the relevant browser stores, we don't expect many people to download them from there.
They are bundled with ZAP (as part of the [Client Side Integration](/docs/desktop/addons/client-side-integration/) add-on) 
and are automatically installed on the browsers launched from ZAP.

#### ZAP Recorder Extension

The Recorder extension is a cut down version of the Full extension, and only allows you to record scripts, it will not try to stream any data to ZAP.

You will need to install this extension manually, as it's designed to be used where you need to record a script on a machine
without ZAP installed.

As of last month this extension is now available on Edge as well as Firefox and Chrome:

* [Firefox - ZAP by Checkmarx Browser Recorder](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/zap-by-checkmarx-recorder/)
* [Chrome - ZAP by Checkmarx Browser Recorder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zap-by-checkmarx-recorder/belmenkmkfloppjbbgibipmgcmnkaiki)
* [Edge - ZAP by Checkmarx Browser Recorder](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/zap-by-checkmarx-recorder/okgkpllibfpmngdhhponlojjgeabfeee)

#### ZAP in Ten / ADDO Videos

Unfortunately the ZAP in Ten and All Day Dev Ops videos have been deleted from Vidyard. We never had copies of these videos
and it was not possible to download them from that site, so they are probably gone for good ðŸ˜¢.

However, as they were getting fairly old and a bit out of date this could be a good time to record a new series, 
starting from scratch again ðŸ˜€.

More news when we have it.

## Ongoing Work

Authentication will still be a focus for us, but we will also be starting to change our focus to look at both crawling modern web apps more effectively, and the scan rules.
