The following people are happy to give free ZAP talks and/or training in their respective locations.

To contact all evangelists please use the https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-evangelists group.

OK, so it looks like this table hasnt migrated from the previous Google Code wiki quite as well as we would have liked :/ Theres a scroll bar at the bottom which will show you more info which you'll need to use until we sort this out!

**Most ZAP evangelists will travel to give talks or training provided expenses are covered.**

Anyone can be a ZAP Evangelist - you just need to feel comfortable talking about ZAP.

Please add your details to this page, or post your details to the ZAP Evangelists thread on the ZAP Developer Group.

You can also post to the above thread for advice and guidance on giving ZAP talks or training, or contact Simon directly.

And when you do arrange events please let us know so that we can update the ZAP Talks tab on the OWASP wiki.
