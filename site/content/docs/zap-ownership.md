ZAP is an independent Open Source project controlled by the [ZAP Core Team](/docs/team/) and supported by 
[Checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/).

It is known as "ZAP by Checkmarx" because 3 of the Core Team are employed by Checkmarx to work
on ZAP, for more details see the blog post [ZAP Has Joined Forces With Checkmarx](/blog/2024-09-24-zap-has-joined-forces-with-checkmarx/).

The ZAP Team regrettably had to take ZAP out of [OWASP](https://owasp.org) 
in [September 2023](/blog/2023-08-01-zap-is-joining-the-software-security-project/) 
in order to obtain enough funding to keep maintaining and improving the software.

The ZAP Team are still OWASP supporters and some of us are still OWASP Project leaders.
