We are hoping to take part in GSoC 2024 as a new GSoC organisation.

Do check out the GSoC [Advice and Guidance](../advice-and-guidance/)

### Potential Projects

#### gRPC Support

Issue: [#7695](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7695) gRPC Support 

gRPC requests should already be shown in the History / Sites tree as binary requests.

This project would add support for:

* A gRPC body view/editor
* A gRPC variant
* gRPC fuzzing support
* A set of ascan rules which specifically target gRPC requests, e.g.
  * Changing types
  * Trying to call other classes / methods

#### Web Based UI

{{<youtube uuid="s8DKKTTHsGM" small="true">}}

The ZAP Desktop GUI is showing its age. A replacement UI implemented using a modern web framework could prove to be very popular.

The current ZAP desktop has a huge range of features, so we do not expect this project to implement all of them.

It should:

* Support a set of key features (e.g. History, Sites Tree, viewing and manipulating Requests and Responses).
* Be plugable (to allow add-ons to implement their own content)
* Be easy to extend
* Be easy to maintain
* Be secure (!)
* Load quickly
* Look good and be a pleasure to use

#### AI Integration

How could we use AI to make ZAP more effective? 

* Understand the technologies behind an app better?
* Suggest more effective payloads?
* Improve false positive detection?
* Generate better reports?

This project is all about exploring those possibilities and finding out what actually works.

#### Your Own Idea

We are always delighted to hear from contributors who have their own ideas for projects. You are encouraged to discuss these with us :grin:.

### Mentors

For all projects the mentors will be at least 2 of the ZAP Core Team:
  * [Simon Bennetts](/docs/team/psiinon/)
  * [Ricardo Pereira](/docs/team/thc202/)
  * [Rick Mitchell](/docs/team/kingthorin/)
  * [Akshath Kothari](/docs/team/ricekot/)
