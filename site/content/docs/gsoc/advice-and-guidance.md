If you would like to contribute to ZAP as part of Google Summer of Code then you should start
[contributing](/docs/contribute/) to ZAP ASAP.

We will only consider candidates who have made a code PR to ZAP that has been merged.

Candidates who have made more contributions to ZAP will be at an advantage, so start with 
[good-first-issues](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
and then move onto
[good-second-issues](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+second+issue%22).

Don't worry if you can't see any suitable issues - just get in touch with us via the 
[ZAP Developer Group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) and we'll find something for you.

Also get in touch with us to discuss potential projects - we are very happy to talk to you about potential projects,
via email, irc, video calls - whatever works for you.

We are also very happy to review project proposals before they are submitted - most of the successful GSoC proposals were
reviewed by the ZAP team before their final submission.

You can see a set of suggested projects on the [GSoC 2024](../2024) page.
