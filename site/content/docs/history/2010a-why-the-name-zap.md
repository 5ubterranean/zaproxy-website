I find naming things hard. It is easier if the tool has a very specific purpose, but ZAP has lots of uses.

When I was a developer I always wrote command line scripts.
If I thought I might need them again then I would call them something sensible, something that would help me find them again. 
But I also wrote one off scripts that I knew I would never use again. I always ended up calling those scripts “__zap__” or “__pow__” - think of cartoons: “ZAP! POW!”
I struggled with names for my fork of paros proxy and I kept on thinking of those two options.

ZAP seemed right - you could imagine someone saying “We need to ZAP this website” :wink:
So I chose ZAP, and somehow resisted adding the exclamation mark!

But I also wanted it to be __ZAP__ (in capitals) rather than zap (think of the cartoons again) and the easiest way to make that happen was for ZAP to stand for something, so ZAP is actually a backronym :smile:.

What could the letters stand for?

__P__ for proxy was easy, and __A__ for attack didn’t take me too long either.

The __Z__ was much harder, and in the end I decided it did not need to stand for anything.
But I REALLY did not want Americans pronouncing it as __Zee__ - that just sounds so wrong to me :stuck_out_tongue:.

So __Z__ stands for __Zed__ :laughing:.
