While I was still finalising the first ZAP release someone else beat me to it :worried:.

After years of being neglected, Paros was also forked by [Axel Neumann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/axelneumann/) who called his version [AndiParos](https://code.google.com/archive/p/andiparos/).

I'll have to admit that I was very disheartened and seriously considered abandoning my plans for ZAP.

However on reflection I decided to press ahead anyway. It looked like Axel's focus was on pentesting while I wanted to create a web security tool for developers, and I also wanted to use the Apache V2 license rather than the GPL v2 license Axel had chosen.

Axel actually spotted ZAP before I announced it and you can see our first conversations here:
https://groups.google.com/g/zaproxy-develop/c/kq3ewjifrOc/m/Vrj6DnF0jB4J

In time we agreed to work together and Axel became the second contributor to work on ZAP, after myself.
