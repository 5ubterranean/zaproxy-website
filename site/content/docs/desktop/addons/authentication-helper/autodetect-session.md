# Auto-Detect Session Management

This [add-on](/docs/desktop/addons/authentication-helper/) adds a new Session Management type which you can use to indicate that the [Session Management Request Identification](/docs/desktop/addons/authentication-helper/session-mgmt-id/) passive scan rule should attempt to configure the Session Management method automatically.
