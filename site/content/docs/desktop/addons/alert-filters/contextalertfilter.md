# Context Alert Filters


Context [Alert Filters](/docs/desktop/addons/alert-filters/) allow you to automatically override the risk levels
of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan rules within a context.
The Alert Filters will be exported and imported with the context -
they will not persist over ZAP sessions unless the context is imported again.


This add-on adds an 'Alert Filters' panel to the contexts dialog.  

The panel shows a list of all of the Alert Filters along with buttons for
adding, removing, and deleting them.
Adding or modifying an Alert Filter will display the [Alert Filter Dialog](/docs/desktop/addons/alert-filters/alertfilterdialog/).
