# Options Global Alert Filters

This Options screen allows you to configure Global [Alert Filters](/docs/desktop/addons/alert-filters/) which allow you to
automatically override the risk levels of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan rules.
Unlike [Context Alert Filters](/docs/desktop/addons/alert-filters/contextalertfilter/) they apply to all alerts raised,
not just those raised in a specific context.  
They will also be persisted across ZAP sessions.

The screen shows a list of all of the Global Alert Filters along with buttons for
adding, removing, and deleting them.

Adding or modifying an Alert Filter will display the [Alert Filter Dialog](/docs/desktop/addons/alert-filters/alertfilterdialog/).
