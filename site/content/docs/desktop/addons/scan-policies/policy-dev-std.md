# Developer Standard Policy

A developer focused policy meant to perform fairly quickly while providing a greater set of results than the CICD policy, intended for use in a dev environment.

* A superset of Developer CICD
* Intended to run in a dev environment
* No environmental / server related rules
* No rules with high false positives
* No timing attacks
* No informational only rules
* Can include longer running rules

For the list of scan rules included see the [Alert Tag: POLICY_DEV_STD](/alerttags/policy_dev_std/) page.
