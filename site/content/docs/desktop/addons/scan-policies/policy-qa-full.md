# QA Full Policy

A quality assurance focused policy, including a superset of the [QA standard](/docs/desktop/addons/scan-policies/policy-qa-std/) with a greater variety of potential findings with more environmental/server related rules, intended for use in a QA/Staging environment.

* Intended to run in a QA / Staging environment which is close to production
* A superset of Developer Full (and QA Standard) but with more env / server rules enabled

For the list of scan rules included see the [Alert Tag: POLICY_QA_FULL](/alerttags/policy_qa_full/) page.
