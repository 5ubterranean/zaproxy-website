# QA Standard Policy

A quality assurance focused policy meant to perform fairly quickly while providing a greater set of results than developer policies, intended for use in a QA/staging environment.

* Intended to run in a QA / Staging environment which is close to production
* A superset of Developer Standard but with important env / server rules enabled
* Not env issues that should have been fixed by everyone

For the list of scan rules included see the [Alert Tag: POLICY_QA_STD](/alerttags/policy_qa_std/) page.
