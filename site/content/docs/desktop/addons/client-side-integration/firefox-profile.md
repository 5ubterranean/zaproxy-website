# Client Side Integration - Firefox Profile

This [add-on](/docs/desktop/addons/client-side-integration/) creates a Firefox profile called 'zap-client-profile' and sets it as the default profile that ZAP will use. This profile enables the ZAP Firefox extension for all sites.

If you choose to use another profile then you will need to manually approve the ZAP extension for every
site you use it for, every time you launch a browser from ZAP.

This is a Firefox restriction - for more details see Bugzilla
[Bug 183609](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1836309).
