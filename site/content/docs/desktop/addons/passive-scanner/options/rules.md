# Passive Scan Rules


This screen allows you to configure the passive scan rules.  

### Threshold

This controls how likely ZAP is to report potential vulnerabilities.  

* If you select Off then the scan rule won't run.
* If you select Low then more potential issues will be raised which may increase the number of false positives.
* If you select High then fewer potential issues will be raised which may mean that some real issues are missed (false negatives).
