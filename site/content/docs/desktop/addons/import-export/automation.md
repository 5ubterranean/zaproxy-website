# Automation Framework Support

This add-on supports the Automation Framework.   

## Job: import

The import job allows you to import HAR (HTTP Archive File), ModSecurity2 Logs, ZAP Messages or a file containing URLs locally.

```
  - type: import                       # Import a file of requests
    parameters:
      type:                            # String: One of ['har', 'modsec2', 'url', 'zap_messages']
      fileName:                        # String: Name of the file containing the data
```

## Job: export

The export job allows you to export messages in HAR format or as URLs as well as exporting the Sites Tree in the [Sites Tree format](/docs/desktop/addons/import-export/sitestreeformat/). The supported sources are:

* all: all messages, including those generated by ZAP, supports 'har' and 'url'
* history: the manually/proxied messages, supports 'har' and 'url'
* sitestree: the ZAP Sites Tree, supports 'yaml'

```
  - type: export            # Exports data into a file
      parameters:
        context:            # String: Name of the context from which to export. Default: first context
        type:               # String: One of 'har', 'url', 'yaml'. Default: 'har'
        source:             # String: One of 'history', 'sitestree', 'all'. Default: 'history'
        fileName:           # String: Name/path to the file
```

## Job: prune

The prune job allows you to remove nodes from the Sites Tree using data from a file. The file should use the [Sites Tree format](/docs/desktop/addons/import-export/sitestreeformat/).

```
  - type: prune           # Prunes nodes from the Sites Tree using Sites Tree data (YAML) from a file
    parameters:
      fileName:           # String: Name/path to the file
```
