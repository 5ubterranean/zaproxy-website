# Image Location and Privacy Scanner

The following passive scan rule is included in this add-on:

## Image Location and Privacy Scanner

Passively scans for GPS location exposure in images during normal security
assessments of websites. Image Location Scanner assists in situations where
end users may post profile images and possibly give away their home location,
e.g. a dating site or children's chatroom. A whitepaper on this can be found
at http://veggiespam.com/ils/

Note: In order for this scanner to operate images cannot be filtered out via
the settings "Global Exclude URL" or the Session Properties for "Exclude from
Proxy".
