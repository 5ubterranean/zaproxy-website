# Automation Framework - passiveScan-config Job

This job allows you to manage the passive scan configuration.

The passive scanner runs against all requests and responses that are generated by ZAP or are proxied through it.
If you want to configure the passive scan configuration then you should typically do so before running any other jobs.
However you can run this job later, or multiple times, if you want different jobs to use different passive scan configurations.

```
  - type: passiveScan-config           # Passive scan configuration
    parameters:
      maxAlertsPerRule: 10             # Int: Maximum number of alerts to raise per rule
      scanOnlyInScope: true            # Bool: Only scan URLs in scope (recommended)
      maxBodySizeInBytesToScan:        # Int: Maximum body size to scan, default: 0 - will scan all messages
```
