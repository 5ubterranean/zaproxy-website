# Automation Framework - Job Outcome Tests

The automation framework supports testing the job outcomes based on conditions that you can set in the YAML file.

The currently supported tests are:

* [alert](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/test-alert/) - Alert tests - validate the presence or absence of specified alerts
* [monitor](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/test-monitor/) - Monitor tests - allow you to stop long running jobs based on statistic thresholds
* [stats](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/test-stats/) - Statistics tests - test any of the statistics maintained by ZAP
* [url](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/test-url/) - URL tests - validate the presence/absence of a URL and itâ€™s specific expressions in the HTTP response/request
