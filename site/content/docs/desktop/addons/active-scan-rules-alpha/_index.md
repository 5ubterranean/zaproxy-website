## LDAP Injection {#id-40015}

LDAP Injection may be possible. It may be possible for an attacker to bypass authentication controls, and to view and modify arbitrary data in the LDAP directory.

Latest code: [LdapInjectionScanRule.java](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/blob/main/addOns/ascanrulesAlpha/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/ascanrulesAlpha/LdapInjectionScanRule.java)

Alert ID: [40015](/docs/alerts/40015/).

## NoSQL Injection - MongoDB {#id-40033}

This rule attempts to identify MongoDB specific NoSQL Injection vulnerabilities. It attempts various types of attacks including: boolean based, error based, time based, and authentication bypass. It will also attempt JSON parameter specific payloads if the scan is configured to include JSON parameter variants.

Latest code: [MongoDbInjectionScanRule.java](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/blob/main/addOns/ascanrulesAlpha/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/ascanrulesAlpha/MongoDbInjectionScanRule.java)

Alert ID: [40033](/docs/alerts/40033/).

## Web Cache Deception {#id-40039}

This rule attempts to identify Web Cache Deception vulnerabilities. It checks whether a static path appended to original URIs can be used to leak sensitive user information or not.

* User must be authenticated before using this rule

Latest code: [WebCacheDeceptionScanRule.java](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/blob/main/addOns/ascanrulesAlpha/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/ascanrulesAlpha/WebCacheDeceptionScanRule.java)
