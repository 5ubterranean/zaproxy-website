# Postman Support

This add-on will allow you to import Postman collections through the UI, importing through the API and command line is under development.   

It also supports the [Automation Framework](/docs/desktop/addons/postman-support/automation/).

## UI

A menu item is added to the Import menu:

* Import a Postman Collection

Any variables defined in the collection will be replaced with their values. Additionally, the dialog allows providing a comma-separated list of variables as key-value pairs in the format `key1=value1,key2=value2,...`, these variables will have precedence over the collection ones.

## API

The following operations are added to the API:

* ACTION importFile (file, endpointUrl)
* ACTION importUrl (url, endpointUrl)

## Command Line

The following Command Line options are added:

* -postmanfile \<filename\> : Imports a Postman collection from the specified file name
* -postmanurl \<url\> : Imports a Postman collection from the specified URL
* -postmanendpointurl \<url\> : The endpoint URL, to override the base URLs present in the Postman collection
