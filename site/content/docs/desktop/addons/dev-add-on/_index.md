# Dev Add-On

An add-on to help with development of ZAP. It starts a simple test web service, which by default will be accessible via http://localhost:9091

It provides:

## API Pages

Two simple OpenAPI specs, both of which require no authentication. One of the APIs described by the specs can only be accessed when authenticated.

## Authentication Pages

A growing set of authentication pages, for use in testing ZAP authentication handling.

## HTML Pages

A set of pages which store various types of data in localStorage and sessionStorage.
