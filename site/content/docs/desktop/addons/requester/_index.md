# Requester Add-on

An add-on that allows to manually edit and send messages.

By default it provides a [workspace tab](/docs/desktop/addons/requester/tab/) and a [dialog](/docs/desktop/addons/requester/dialogs/) for HTTP messages.

Other add-ons might build on top of the provided infrastructure
to support their own specific messages (e.g. WebSocket).
