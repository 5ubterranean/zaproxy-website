# Requester

Adds a new "Requester" panel next to the standard "Request" and "Response" ones.

The Requester Panel acts like the Manual Request Editor but supports as many sub tabs as you need.

Right click on a request in any of the other ZAP tabs and select "Open in Requester Tab..." to open that request in a new Requester tab.
You can also use the Control / Command + "W" key to do the same thing via the keyboard.

The tabs are initially numbered but if you double click on the tab then a dialog will be shown which will allow you to rename it.
