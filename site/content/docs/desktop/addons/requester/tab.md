# Requester Tab

The Requester tab in the workspace panel, next to the standard "Request" and "Response" tabs.

The Requester tab acts like the [Manual
Request Editor dialogs](/docs/desktop/addons/requester/dialogs/) but supports as many sub-tabs as you need.

Right click on a request in any of the other ZAP tabs and select
"Open in Requester Tab..." to open that request in a new Requester
tab. You can also use the Control / Command + "W" key to do the same
thing via the keyboard.

The tabs are initially numbered but if you double click on the
tab then a dialog will be shown which will allow you to rename it.
