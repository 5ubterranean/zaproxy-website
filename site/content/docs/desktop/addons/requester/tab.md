# Requester Tab

The Requester tab in the workspace panel, next to the standard "Request" and "Response" tabs.

The Requester tab acts like the [Manual
Request Editor dialogs](/docs/desktop/addons/requester/dialogs/) but supports as many sub-tabs as you need.

Right click on a request in any of the other ZAP tabs and select
"Open in Requester Tab..." to open that request in a new Requester
tab. You can also use the Control / Command + "W" key to do the same
thing via the keyboard.

The tabs are initially numbered but if you double click on the
tab then a dialog will be shown which will allow you to rename it.

Each tab has a footer which allows you to find strings in the
HTTP request and response. The footer shows the number of case
insensitive matches and allows you to loop through them. The footer
also shows the time taken for the request, the body length, and the
total length.
