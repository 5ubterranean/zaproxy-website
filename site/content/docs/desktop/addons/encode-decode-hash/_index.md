# Encode / Decode / Hash dialog


This allows you to encode, decode or hash text.

## Common Fields

The dialog has one field that is common to all of the tabs:

### Text to be encoded/decoded/hashed:

This field is for the text that you want to be encoded, decoded or hashed.  
If any text is selected when the dialog is invoked then it will be put in this field. The other fields will be updated dynamically if you change the text  

## Toolbar

* ![](/docs/desktop/addons/encode-decode-hash/images/ui-tab--plus.png) Add New Tab - Adds a new tab to the dialog.
* ![](/docs/desktop/addons/encode-decode-hash/images/ui-tab--delete.png) Remove Selected Tab - Removes the selected (or current) tab from the dialog.
* ![](/docs/desktop/addons/encode-decode-hash/images/ui-output--plus.png) Add Output Panel to Current Tab - Adds an output panel to the current tab.
* Reset - Reset all the tabs/panels to their default state.
* Options - Will open the options dialog, with the focus set to the Encode/Decode/Hash options panel.
* Help - Will open the User Guide, with the content pane preset to the Encode/Decode/Hash add-on's help page.

## Output Panel(s) Context Menu

* Find - Brings up a standard input dialog to allow searching within a text area.
* Copy - Standard copy functionality.
* Paste - Standard paste functionality.
* Delete Output Panel - Removes the relevant output text area.
* Replace Input Text - Replaces the input text content, based on the selection or full content of the relevant output text area. (Only active if the text area has content.)

## Default Dialog Tabs \& Panels

In its default state the Encode/Decode/Hash dialog displays tabs and output panels with the following setup:

### Encode tab fields

* Base 64 Encode
* Base 64 URL Encode
* URL Encode
* Full URL Encode
* ASCII Hex Encode
* HTML Encode
* Full HTML Encode
* JavaScript Encode

### Decode tab fields

* Base 64 Decode
* Base 64 URL Decode
* URL Decode
* Full URL Decode
* ASCII Hex Decode
* HTML Decode
* JavaScript Decode

### Hash tab fields

* SHA256 Hash
* SHA1 Hash
* MD5 Hash

### Illegal UTF-8

* 2 byte
* 3 byte
* 4 byte

### Unicode

* Escaped Text
* Unescaped Text

## Predefined Encode / Decode / Hash Processors

### Encoders

#### 2 byte Illegal UTF-8

Will display with an illegal UTF-8 character sequence with 2 bytes.

#### 3 byte Illegal UTF-8

Will display illegal UTF-8 character sequence with 3 bytes.

#### 4 byte Illegal UTF-8

Will display an illegal UTF-8 character sequence with 4 bytes.

#### ASCII Hex Encode

Will display the ASCII hex encoding of the text you enter.

### Base 64 Encode

Will display the base 64 encoding of the text you enter.  

### Base 64 URL Encode

Will display the base 64 URL encoding of the text you enter. Base64URL is a modification to the primary base 64 standard the purpose of which is the ability to use the encoding result as filename or URL address. Base64URL is described in [RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648), which notes that the standard base 64 alphabet includes characters that are invalid for URLs and file names (for example: plus sign and question mark are problematic). The main standard will encode `<<???>>` to `PDw/Pz8+Pg==` while Base64URL will convert it to `PDw_Pz8-Pg`.

#### Escaped Unicode Text

Will display escaped Unicode characters. For example, the text `Açores` would be encoded as `%u0041%u00e7%u006f%u0072%u0065%u0073`.

#### HTML Encode

Will display the HTML encoding of the text you enter. For example, the text `"piñata"` would be encoded as `&quot;pi&ntilde;ata&quot;`.

#### Full HTML Encode

Will display the full HTML encoding of the text you enter. For example, the text `<script>` would be encoded as `&#60;&#115;&#99;&#114;&#105;&#112;&#116;&#62;`

#### JavaScript Encode

Will display escaped JavaScript literals of the text you enter. For example, the text `"2￠"` would be encoded as `\"2\uFFE0\"`.

#### URL Encode

Will display the URL encoding of the text you enter.

#### Full URL Encode

Will display the full URL encoding of the text you enter (all characters converted to HEX and percent prepended).

#### Unescaped Unicode Text

Will display the unescaped Unicode characters. For example, the text `%u0041%u00e7%u006f%u0072%u0065%u0073` would be decoded as `Açores`.

#### Morse Code Encoder

Will display dits (.) and dahs (-) and word breaks (/) representing the provided Alpha Numeric (including space) input. For example, the text `SOS SOS` would be encoded as `... --- .../... --- ...`.

### Decoders

#### ASCII Hex Decode

Will display the ASCII hex decoding of the text you enter.  
If there is no valid decoding then the field will be disabled.

#### Base 64 Decode

Will display the base 64 decoding of the text you enter.  
Leveraging a [Mime decoder](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Base64.html#getMimeDecoder()) to handle wrapped lines.

#### Base 64 URL Decode

Will display the base 64 URL decoding of the text you enter. Base64URL is a modification to the primary base 64 standard the purpose of which is the ability to use the encoding result as filename or URL address. Base64URL is described in [RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648), which notes that the standard base 64 alphabet includes characters that are invalid for URLs and file names (for example: plus sign and question mark are problematic).

#### HTML Decode

Will display the HTML decoding of the text you enter. For example, the text `&quot;pi&ntilde;ata&quot;` would be decoded as `"piñata"`.

#### JavaScript Decode

Will display the unescaped JavaScript literals of the text you enter. For example, the text `\"2\uFFE0\"` would be decoded as `"2￠"`.

#### URL Decode

Will display the URL decoding of the text you enter.

#### Full URL Decode

Will display the URL decoding of the text you enter (percent signs removed and HEX decoded).

#### Morse Code Decoder

Will display Alpha Numeric (including space) output representing the provided morse code input. For example, the text `... --- .../... --- ...` would be encoded as `SOS SOS`.

### Hashers

#### MD5 Hash

Will display the MD5 hash of the text you enter.

#### SHA1 Hash

Will display the SHA1 hash of the text you enter.

#### SHA256 Hash

Will display the SHA256 hash of the text you enter.

## Other Processors

The following processors can also be added to any tab.

### Custom

Custom "Encode/Decode" scripts can be created/added to the Scripts Tree and used by custom Output Panels. They should return `EncodeDecodeResult` objects as indicated by the templates. However, in the event that users aren't careful in doing so will return other data types leveraging their `toString()` implementation (which may or may not be useful/obvious at first glance).

### Utility

#### To Lower Case

Converts the input to all lower case characters.

#### Remove Whitespace

Removes all whitespace characters from the text, based on [Character.isWhiteSpace(char)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Character.html#isWhitespace(char)).

#### Reverse

Reverses the order of the input.

#### To Upper Case

Converts the input to all upper case characters.

#### ASCify

Converts text removing accents/diacritics/ligatures (perhaps not fully, due to operation in compatibility mode) leaving only ASCII characters. Examples:
* `Tĥïŝ ĩš â fůňķŷ Šťŕĭńġ: ﬁ. étrange.` becomes `This is a funky String: fi. etrange.`.
* `鸟儿` becomes an empty string (all characters are dropped).

* [Wikipedia: Transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration)

### Miscellaneous

#### PowerShell Encode

Converted to UTF-16LE and base64 encoded. Equivalent to one of the following examples (encoding "dir"):

` printf "dir"| iconv -t UTF-16LE | base64 -w 0 -`


    $command = 'dir'
    $bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($command)
    $encodedCommand = [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes)
    echo $encodedCommand


Resulting in: `ZABpAHIA`.

Which can be leveraged via something like the following (where `$encodedCommand` is set to the encoded value `ZABpAHIA`):  
`powershell -exec bypass -enc $encodedCommand`
