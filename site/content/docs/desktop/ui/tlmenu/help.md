### About ZAP

This displayed the 'about' dialog.

### Support Info...

Displays a dialog that contains information which is useful when troubleshooting or seeking support. Such as:  
Version, installed add-ons and versions, operating system, java version, locale info, and ZAP Home Directory path. This information can be copied and pasted.   
The dialog includes an "Open ZAP Home" button, which assuming the OS supports the necessary functionality, will open the ZAP Home Directory (for logs or configuration files) when clicked.   
The dialog includes a "Save SBOM zip..." button, which will prompt you for the name of a zip file which it will generate containing all of the available [SBOM](/docs/desktop/start/features/sbom/) files.

### Check for Updates...

This checks to see if you are running the latest version of ZAP.

### Desktop ZAP User Guide

Note that [add-ons](/docs/desktop/start/features/addons/) can add additional menu items.
