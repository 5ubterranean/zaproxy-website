# Options Breakpoints screen

This screen allows you to configure the [breakpoint](/docs/desktop/start/features/breakpoints/) options:

### Confirm drop trapped message

Asks for confirmation when a request or response is dropped.

### Only break on messages in scope

The 'global' breakpoint will only be triggered by requests that are in [scope](/docs/desktop/start/features/scope/).  
Custom breakpoints will not be affected.

### ZAP always on top when breakpoint hit

If selected this will mean that ZAP stays on top of all other windows whenever a breakpoint is hit.  

### Break buttons mode

This controls whether there is a single combined break button on the [Top Level Toolbar](/docs/desktop/ui/tltoolbar/) or separate ones for Requests and Responses.
