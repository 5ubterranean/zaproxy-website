# Release 2.11.0

This is the OWASP 20th anniversary bug fix and enhancement release, which requires a minimum of Java 8. Note that a minimum of Java 11 is recommended, especially for high DPI displays.   

These release notes do not include all of the changes included in add-ons updated since 2.10.0.   

Some of the more significant enhancements include:

### Alert Tags

Alerts can now be tagged with arbitrary keys or key=value pairs.  
The active and passive scan rules have been updated to include tags for the OWASP Top 10 2021 and 2017 - these are also now shown on the website [Alert Details](/docs/alerts/) pages.

### Automation Framework

The Automation Framework is a new way to automate ZAP and is expected to become the default option for most use cases. For more details see the [Automation Framework](/docs/automate/automation-framework/) page on the website.

### Report Generation

The new [Report Generation](/docs/desktop/addons/report-generation/) add-on allows you to generate much more flexible reports with access to much more data. The previous reporting add-ons have been removed from the marketplace as they provide less functionality and are no longer maintained.  
New report templates include:

* Risk and Confidence HTML - the new default report
* Modern HTML Report with themes and options
* High Level Report Sample
* Traditional HTML Report with requests and responses

"Traditional" templates have been added which match the old reports for anyone who relies on their formats.

### OAST Support

The new [OAST Support](/docs/desktop/addons/oast-support/) add-on allows you to find and exploit out-of-band vulnerabilities. This add-on is alpha at the time of the 2.11.0 release but is expected to be updated soon, so check the help pages for the latest features.

### Retest

The new [Retest](/docs/desktop/addons/retest/) add-on allows you to retest for presence/absence of previously generated alerts. This add-on is alpha at the time of the 2.11.0 release but is expected to be updated soon, so check the help pages for the latest features.

### Docker

The Docker stable and bare images will now be updated monthly, typically around the start of the month.  
The updates will include any updated add-ons and any changes to the packaged scans. No core changes will be included in these updates.  
The images will be tagged by date in case you wish to stay on a specific version.  
The packaged scans are being migrated to use the Automation Framework - this migration will continue over the life of 2.11.0.

### Statistics

A significant number of statistics have been added to the core, and are being added to add-ons. In part this is driven by the Automation Framework which can make direct use of statistics for sanity checks.  
New core statistics include:

* stats.api.call.\<format\>.\<component\>.\<request-type\>.\<name\> : The number of times the given API endpoint has been called
* stats.api.error.\<format\>.\<component\>.\<request-type\>.\<name\> : The number of times the given API endpoint has returned an error
* stats.ascan.\<rule-id\>.alerts : The number of alerts the given active scan rule has raised
* stats.ascan.\<rule-id\>.skipped : The number of alerts the given active scan rule has been skipped
* stats.ascan.\<rule-id\>.started : The number of alerts the given active scan rule has been started
* stats.ascan.\<rule-id\>.time : The cumulative number of milliseconds that the given active scan rule has run for

* stats.ascan.time : The cumulative number of milliseconds that active scanner has run for
* stats.ascan.urls : The number of URLs the active scanner has requested
* stats.break.drop : The number of times a request or response has been dropped via a break point
* stats.break.hit : The number of times a break point has been hit
* stats.break.step : The number of times a break point has been stepped through
* stats.pscan.\<rule-id\>.alerts : The number of alerts raised by the given scan rule
* stats.pscan.\<rule-id\>.time : The cumulative number of milliseconds taken to run the given scan rule
* stats.script.call.\<engine-name\>.\<type\> : The number of times the given type of script has been called
* stats.script.error.\<engine-name\>.\<type\> : The number of times the given type of script has been returned an error
* stats.spider.started : The number of times the spider has been started
* stats.spider.stopped : The number of times the spider has been stopped (as opposed to completing)
* stats.spider.time : The total number of milliseconds the spider has run for across all scans
* stats.spider.url.error : The number of URLs the spider has found but failed to access
* stats.spider.url.found : The number of URLs the spider has found and accessed
