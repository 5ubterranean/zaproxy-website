# OWASP ZAP Desktop User Guide

Welcome to the The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) Desktop User Guide.  

This is available both as context sensitive help within ZAP and online at
https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/

ZAP is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for
developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing.

ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually.

If you are new to ZAP then its recommended that you look at the [Getting Started](/docs/desktop/start/) section.

ZAP is a fork of the open source variant of the [Paros Proxy](/docs/desktop/paros/).
