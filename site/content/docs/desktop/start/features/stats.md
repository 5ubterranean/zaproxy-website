# Statistics

ZAP maintains statistics which can help you understand what is really happening when interacting with large applications.

The statistics are available via the [API](/docs/desktop/start/features/api/) and can be also sent to a Statsd server when
configured via the [Options Statistics screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/stats/).

The full set of statistics maintained by the ZAP core and add-ons are maintained on the ZAP website:
[Internal Statistics](/docs/internal-statistics/).
