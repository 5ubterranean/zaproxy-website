The application performed a suspicious input transformation that may indicate a security vulnerability. The input was transformed in an unexpected way, suggesting potential issues with input validation, encoding/decoding, or expression evaluation. This could indicate vulnerabilities such as server-side template injection, expression language injection, unicode normalization issues, or other input processing flaws that may be exploitable.
