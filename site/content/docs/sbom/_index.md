ZAP includes a runtime Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generated by [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) for both the ZAP core and all of the add-ons maintained by the ZAP team. Each SBOM will appear as a file called “bom.json” included at the root of the ZAP JARs.

Runtime SBOMs for the ZAP core and the add-ons you have installed can be accessed in ZAP as per the [Software Bill of Materials](/docs/desktop/start/features/sbom/)
help page.

Note that SBOMs may not be available if you run ZAP from the source code, and some 3rd party add-ons may also not define them.

The full set of available build time add-on SBOMs are:
