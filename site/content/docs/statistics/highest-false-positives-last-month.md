title: Highest False Positives Last Month
---

These were the alerts most frequently flagged as false positives using [Alert Filters](/docs/desktop/addons/alert-filters/) last month.

Note that this does not necessarily mean they _are_ false positives, it could mean that the people using ZAP are not interested in these specific vulnerabilities.
