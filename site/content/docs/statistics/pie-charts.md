Some stats are shown for all pings and for desktop only pings.
The desktop pings show a significantly different profile, possibly because many automated ZAP scans run in the cloud
and many cloud providers are located in the USA. 
We also know that quite a few companies run ZAP as a SaaS offering which will also skew the stats.
