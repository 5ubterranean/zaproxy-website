### Overview

Gin & Juice Shop is a closed source vulnerable app maintained by [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/).

Despite claiming to be a modern app is is actually relatively traditional (it is not a Single Page App), which makes it easier to scan.

* Online: https://ginandjuice.shop/

> [!WARNING]
> We are aware that a 3rd Party has published a blog post claiming that ZAP is not effective when scanning Gin & Juice Shop.
> We have pointed out the mistakes that they have made but to date they have not corrected their misinformation.
> Luckily as ZAP is Open Source you should be able to easily test this for yourself given the information below. 

### Quick Start

New to ZAP and just want to quickly run ZAP against Gin &amp; Juice Shop?

Just run these commands:

```bash
# Download the recommended plan using curl, or use any other suitable tool
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/community-scripts/refs/heads/main/other/af-plans/FullScanGinNJuiceAuth.yaml

# Run ZAP using the stable Docker image, mapping the CWD so that Docker can access the file system and export the report
docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw -t zaproxy/zap-stable zap.sh -cmd -autorun wrk/FullScanGinNJuiceAuth.yaml
```

To run this command on Windows see the [relevant documentation](/docs/docker/about/#mounting-the-current-directory).

You will need to have Docker installed. If you do not want to use Docker then you can of course install ZAP locally.

This command should take around 25 minutes (once the Docker image has been downloaded) on a MacBook M2 and should find the following High and Medium risk alerts:

* ðŸ”´ [Cross Site Scripting (DOM Based)](/docs/alerts/40026/)
* ðŸ”´ [Cross Site Scripting (Reflected](/docs/alerts/40012/)
* ðŸ”´ [SQL Injection](/docs/alerts/40018/)
* ðŸ”´ [Vulnerable JS Library](/docs/alerts/10003/)
* ðŸŸ  [Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens](/docs/alerts/10202/)
* ðŸŸ  [CRLF Injection](/docs/alerts/40003/)
* ðŸŸ  [Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set](/docs/alerts/10038/)

It will create an HTML report in your CWD containing full details of all of the issues found.

### Potential Pitfalls

This is an online app which may be unavailable or broken at any point.
It is not possible to run a local version.

### Authentication

Known users (username / password):

* `carlos` / `hunter2`

#### Browser Based Authentication

ZAP can successfully authenticate to this app using 
[Browser Based Authentication](/docs/desktop/addons/authentication-helper/browser-auth/) 
and will successfully identify the session handling and verification.

Note that you should use the URL `https://ginandjuice.shop/login` as there is not an easy to find link to the login page from the top URL.

#### Client Script Authentication

ZAP can successfully authenticate to this app using 
[Client Script Authentication](/docs/desktop/addons/authentication-helper/client-script/) 
and will successfully identify the session handling and verification.

### Recommended Environment

```yaml
env:
  contexts:
  - name: "Gin N Juice Shop"
    urls:
    - https://ginandjuice.shop
    includePaths:
    - https://ginandjuice.shop.*
    excludePaths:
    - https://ginandjuice.shop/logout
    authentication:
      method: browser
      parameters:
        loginPageUrl: https://ginandjuice.shop/login
        loginPageWait: 2
        browserId: firefox
        steps: []
      verification:
        method: poll
        loggedInRegex: \Q 200 OK\E
        loggedOutRegex: \Q 302 Found\E
        pollFrequency: 60
        pollUnits: seconds
        pollUrl: https://ginandjuice.shop/my-account
        pollPostData: ""
    sessionManagement:
      method: headers
      parameters: {}
    users:
    - name: carlos
      credentials:
        password: hunter2
        username: carlos
  parameters: {}
```

### Crawling

All of the spiders are effective against this app. We recommend using the 
[Traditional Spider](/docs/desktop/addons/spider/) as well as one of the modern ones:

* [AJAX Spider](/docs/desktop/addons/ajax-spider/)
* [Client Spider](/docs/desktop/addons/client-side-integration/spider/)


For the AJAX Spider you need to exclude the logout link:

``` yaml
- type: spiderAjax
  parameters:
    context: "Gin N Juice Shop"
    user: carlos
    browserId: firefox-headless
    excludedElements:
    - description: Logout
      element: a
      text: Log out
 ```

### Scanning

Gin & Juice Shop has a well documented set of [vulnerabilities](https://ginandjuice.shop/vulnerabilities).

We have a simple example Automation Framework Plan for performing an authenticated scan:
[FullScanGinNJuiceAuth.yaml](https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts/blob/main/other/af-plans/FullScanGinNJuiceAuth.yaml)

Some of the Gin N Juice shop vulnerabilities can only be found using [OAST](/blog/2021-08-23-oast-with-owasp-zap/). You will need to configure ZAP to use OAST as it is disabled by default, 
due to the fact that it will send data to 3rd party services.
