The [Core Team](/docs/desktop/credits/) is the set of people who have made the most significant contributions to the most recent ZAP releases.
It is also a team - we work together in a collaborative way to make ZAP a better project as per the [Mission Statement](/mission-statement/).

Decisions are made as a group, no one person makes the final decision - either we all agree or we work out a way to ensure everyone is happy with a given approach.

The Core Team communicates very regularly in [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/#zaproxy) and have a 45 min weekly meeting on Fridays at 15:00 UTC.
This meeting is open to anyone who is interested in ZAP development - [get in contact](mailto:zaproxy-admin@googlegroups.com) with us to receive an invite.

We are always looking for new people to join the Core Team, but only people who have significantly contributed to ZAP and work with us to make ZAP a better project will be invited to join.

In addition to making code contributions we are looking for people who:

- Review PRs
- Triage issues
- Answer questions on any social platforms
- Join in discussions with the rest of the Core Team

We expect prospective Core Team members to start doing these things prior to being invited to join. Ideally they will join us in the weekly team meetings and IRC, but we understand that may be difficult depending on timezones and availability - we will do our best to work around such issues.

### Why join the ZAP Core Team?

As well as being a welcoming, community oriented Open Source project it is (we believe) the [world's most popular web security scanner](/blog/2020-04-02-is-zap-the-worlds-most-popular-web-scanner/).

Being part of a significant Open Source project is a great way to learn, grow, and raise your profile in the industry.

It can also really help your career - everyone who has been a member of the ZAP Core Team for any length of time has had job offers due to their association with ZAP. Some of us have even accepted them :smiley:
