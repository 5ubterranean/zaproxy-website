ZAP's governance model is simple.

There are two roles: [general contributors](/docs/desktop/credits/#zap-extended-team), and the [Core Team](/docs/team/).

Decisions within the project are made based on majority rules. That is to say, if someone puts forth a new idea or decision to be made, it is made based on the majority of the team agreeing on the direction/outcome. 

Anyone can work on anything they like. It is a majority Core Team decision as to whether any significant new functionality is adopted (and therefore supported) by the Core Team.

All pull requests must be approved by two members of the Core Team, not including the submitter.
