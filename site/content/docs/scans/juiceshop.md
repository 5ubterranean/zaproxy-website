title: "ZAP vs OWASP Juice Shop"
type: page
EditableContent: true
---
OWASP Juice Shop is "probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application!".

The main project page is https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/

It is actively maintained. 

In this case we use it to check that the [AJAX Spider](/docs/desktop/addons/ajax-spider/) finds all of the expected pages.
Juice Shop was manually explored using a browser - if you find a new URL in Juice Shop that can be discovered by 'normal'
exploration but which is not listed then please [raise an issue](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report.yml).
