## Why Sponsor ZAP?

ZAP is the world's most widely used web app scanner and a GitHub Top 1000 project.

It is open source and completely free of charge.

It is maintained by a relatively small [team](/docs/team/), most of whom work on ZAP in their own time.

Donating to ZAP will allow us to keep on making ZAP better and better.

You will also be able to publicly show your support of the ZAP project and gain brand recognition within a 
community of users who really care about web security.

## How to Sponsor ZAP

You can sponsor the ZAP project via [OWASP](https://owasp.org/donate/?reponame=www-project-zap&title=OWASP+ZAP).

You can also sponsor the following members of the Core team directly - these contributions also count as donations to the ZAP project:

* [thc202](https://github.com/sponsors/thc202)
* [kingthorin](https://github.com/sponsors/kingthorin)
* [ricekot](https://github.com/sponsors/ricekot)

If you have any questions about sponsorship then please [get in touch](mailto:zaproxy-admin@googlegroups.com) - 
we want to make it straightforward and as mutually beneficial as possible.
