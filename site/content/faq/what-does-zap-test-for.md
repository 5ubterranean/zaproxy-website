ZAP supports both [active](/docs/desktop/start/features/ascan/) and [passive](/docs/desktop/start/features/pscan/) scanning.

By default ZAP comes with the following 'release' quality rules:

  * [Release Active Scan Rules](/docs/desktop/addons/active-scan-rules/)
  * [Release Passive Scan Rules](/docs/desktop/addons/passive-scan-rules/)

But you can also download and install:

  * [Beta Active Scan Rules](/docs/desktop/addons/active-scan-rules-beta/)
  * [Beta Passive Scan Rules](/docs/desktop/addons/passive-scan-rules-beta/)
  * [Alpha Active Scan Rules](/docs/desktop/addons/active-scan-rules-alpha/)
  * [Alpha Passive Scan Rules](/docs/desktop/addons/passive-scan-rules-alpha/)

from the [ZAP Marketplace](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/wiki).

And there are also these scripts in the [community
scripts](https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts) repo:

  * [Active scripts](https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts/tree/master/active)
  * [Passive scripts](https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts/tree/master/passive)

The full list of reserved scan ids is maintained in
[scanners.md](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/develop/docs/scanners.md)
