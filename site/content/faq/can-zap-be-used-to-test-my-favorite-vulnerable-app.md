We have a new section of the site focused on how to set up ZAP to scan a variety of test vulnerable web apps:
[ZAP Vs Test Apps](/docs/testapps/).

The following pages will be updated and moved to that section in time.

  * [Damn Vulnerable Web App](/faq/details/setting-up-zap-to-test-dvwa/)
  * [OWASP Pixi](/faq/details/setting-up-zap-to-test-owasp-pixi/)
